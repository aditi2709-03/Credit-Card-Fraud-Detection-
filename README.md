Fraud detection system is necessary in order to reduce the losses incurred by the
people by frauds. A good fraud detection system should be able to identify the
fraud transactions accurately and should make the best decision of the message.

The operations involves data pre-processing, feature engineering and applying
different Machine Learning algorithms to find the best model.
